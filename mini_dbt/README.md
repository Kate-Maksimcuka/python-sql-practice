# Mini dbt-Style Example

This folder simulates a very small dbt project layout for learning purposes.

## Structure

- `models/staging/` – cleaning and standardising raw data
- `models/marts/` – aggregated business-level outputs
- `macros/` – placeholder for future SQL macros

This helps me learn dbt conventions like:
- staging vs mart layers
- model organisation
- clean SQL structure
