# Data Engineering Practice

This repository contains small, beginner-friendly examples related to data engineering.  
The focus is on simple data transformations, SQL fundamentals, and basic ETL logic using Python.

These exercises support my transition into data engineering and reflect concepts from:
- AWS Data Engineering Foundations
- dbt Fundamentals
- SQL and Python courses (QA, Code First Girls, Coursera)

## Contents

### 1. `basic_transforms.py`
Pure Python example demonstrating:
- Filtering data
- Handling missing values
- Grouping by a field
- Working with lists and dictionaries  
(No external libraries required.)

### 2. `simple_etl.py`
A minimal ETL-style script that:
- Extracts data from a CSV
- Applies basic cleaning and filtering
- Saves the cleaned output to a new file  
Shows the basic structure of an ETL process.

### 3. `sql_transformations.sql`
SQL practice examples including:
- SELECT and WHERE filtering
- JOINs
- GROUP BY and aggregations
- Sorting and data cleaning patterns  
Designed to demonstrate core SQL concepts used in data engineering.


## Future Improvements

I plan to expand this repository with additional data engineering practice, including:
- More Python scripts demonstrating transformation and validation logic
- Small mock datasets for testing ETL workflows
- Example SQL files for data cleaning and schema exploration
- Introductory exercises in dbt as I progress through analytics engineering concepts
- Basic cloud-based examples using AWS services (S3, Athena, Glue)

These additions will reflect my ongoing learning and development in data engineering.


## Learning Roadmap

- Strengthen Python fundamentals (loops, functions, file handling)
- Continue improving SQL skills (JOINs, aggregations, subqueries)
- Build confidence with data transformation patterns
- Practice simple ETL workflows and automation
- Move into cloud-based data engineering (AWS)
- Learn analytics engineering tools (dbt)
- Develop small end-to-end project examples

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve as I gain more experience.
