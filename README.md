# Data Engineering Practice

This repository contains small, practical examples related to data engineering.  
The focus is on simple ETL logic, SQL transformations, and basic data handling
as part of my transition into data engineering.

### 1. `simple_etl.py`
A minimal ETL-style script that:
  - Extracts data from a CSV
  - Performs simple transformations (filtering, cleaning, selecting columns)
  - Loads the output into a new CSV

### 2. `sql_transformations.sql`
A set of SQL examples demonstrating:
  - Filtering
  - Aggregations
  - JOINs
  - CTEs
  - Window functions

These exercises are based on concepts from my AWS Data Engineering Foundations and SQL training.

This repository will continue to grow as I progress through more practical data engineering work.
